Dear Arjun,

Thank you for bringing this to our attention.

We would like to clarify that during the incident on 11th April at the P1 Flap Barrier, both Mohit and Pankaj had placed their access cards on the tripod scanner around the same time. In the process, they did not realize that one of the cards had not successfully registered the swipe.

Later, Mohit, assuming his card might have been blocked due to the failed swipe, handed it to Pankaj to verify. Itâ€™s important to note that Mohit did not enter the premises through tailgating. Instead, upon realizing the issue, he contacted the support team, and his card was subsequently unblocked by them.

We appreciate your understanding and assure you that there was no intentional breach of security protocols.
