Hi All,

Hope you’re doing well.

As we wrap up Week 5 of the WG mailbox optimization initiative, I’m sharing a quick update along with a visual summary of the trend so far (attached). The effort continues to deliver measurable improvements in reducing email clutter and improving focus.

Weekly reduction summary:
	•	Week 1: 1,074 emails reduced
	•	Week 2: 919 emails reduced
	•	Week 3: 392 emails reduced
	•	Week 4: 1,227 emails reduced
	•	Week 5: 793 emails reduced
	•	Total: 4,405 emails processed and optimized

Impact Highlights:
	•	550 emails/month are now being auto-categorized with consistent accuracy.
	•	We’ve reviewed all incoming email patterns and created rules to cover all currently possible scenarios.
	•	From WG team feedback, we understand that now more than 95% of emails reaching the inbox are meaningful and require manual attention.

Next Steps:
	•	The foundation is in place. Going forward, we encourage the WG team to reach out to me directly if you notice any recurring cases where a new rule can be created to further optimize the flow.
	•	We’ll continue to fine-tune the rules as needed on a case-by-case basis.

Thanks again to everyone, especially Vladislav and the WG team, for the close collaboration and valuable feedback throughout this effort.
