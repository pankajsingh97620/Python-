Subject: WG Mailbox Optimization – 25% Reduction Achieved | Your Feedback Welcome

Dear [Senior Team / Names],

I’m pleased to share the progress made over the past three weeks in optimizing the WG mailbox. Through a structured approach focused on targeted rules and smart automation — based on keywords, senders, and categorization — we’ve successfully reduced 2,325 emails, amounting to a 25.62% decrease in overall mailbox volume.

This reduction not only streamlines daily mailbox activity but also minimizes noise, allowing for faster response times and improved focus on priority communications.

A special thanks to Vlad, whose guidance was instrumental in helping me understand the behavior of the mailbox and identify which types of emails and rules were truly needed.

I’d greatly value your feedback or suggestions on how we can further optimize this effort or scale it across other mailboxes if needed.

Happy to walk you through the data and improvements if you’d like a closer look.
