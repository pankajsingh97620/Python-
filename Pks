Subject: Extending Mailbox Optimization to FXMMPre – Next Steps

Hi [VP’s Name],

I’m pleased to share that the recent White Glove mailbox optimization initiative was a success—streamlining email management, improving turnaround time, and significantly reducing manual effort. It delivered a strong benefit statement for the WG team.

Key outcomes achieved:
	•	Auto-classification and categorization of emails
	•	Auto-closure of non-actionable emails
	•	Dynamic rules to reduce noise and improve focus

When this was presented to Robyn and Becky, it sparked a valuable question:
Can we extend this to other mailboxes?

Building on this momentum, I propose we begin with the FXMMPre mailbox—leveraging the same foundation, enhanced with a more dynamic and adaptive approach tailored to its unique needs.

I’ll be scheduling a meeting shortly to walk through the plan and align on next steps.

Attaching the summary deck here for your reference. Happy to connect beforehand if you’d like a quick overview.
