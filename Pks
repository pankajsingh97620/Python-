Subject: WG Mailbox Optimization Progress – Request for Feedback

Dear [Senior Team / Specific Names],

Over the past three weeks, I have been working on optimizing the WG mailbox to reduce noise and improve overall efficiency. By implementing targeted rules and automations based on themes such as keywords, senders, and categorization, I have successfully reduced 2,325 emails, which accounts for 25.62% of the total volume.

I would also like to extend my thanks to Vlad, who played a key role in helping me understand the behavior of the WG mailbox and guided me through identifying the right email patterns and rules needed for this transition.

Your feedback and suggestions are most welcome as I look to continue refining and enhancing this process. Please let me know if you’d like a deeper dive into any specific aspect of the work done.
