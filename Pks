We require a system to categorize emails based on priority rules. For example:
	•	If the email body contains “USD”, it should be automatically assigned to the USD desk.
	•	If the email body contains both “USD” and “FXD” or references an FX option, it should be automatically assigned to the FX option desk.
Additionally, we need the ability to prioritize emails according to our specific requirements. In this case, Email 2 should be given a higher priority than Email 1.
