Subject: Follow-up on Switch Breaks and Auto-Coding Issue

Hi Naresh,

As discussed, the switch breaks related to the CLADI departure are being coded to GTSL, and we can take ownership of this break moving forward. Please note the following actions:
	1.	Kindly work with IT to get the auto-coding issue fixed at the earliest.
	2.	As a temporary arrangement, we will not send recoding emails and will directly code the switch breaks to the RECS department. You can then assign them to the correct department accordingly.

Additionally, I would suggest that while delivering the recs to us, please ensure that the breaks are coded to the correct department. This will help us avoid any manual intervention.

Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification.

Best regards,
[Your Name]

Feel free to adjust any details as needed!
