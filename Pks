Issues Observed in New Mailbox Tool

Hi [Manager’s Name],

While working on the new mailbox tool, I have observed the following issues:
	1.	Salesforce email body cannot accommodate more than 35k words. In such cases, we need to switch back to Outlook to respond.
	2.	When we receive emails and want to forward them internally, the tool does not allow it. For example, if we try to change the subject line, the email chain remains intact but we get 2 separate entries in Salesforce instead of one.
	3.	Emails created and saved in Salesforce cannot be sent directly if the recipient’s email ID is external. The tool allows us to draft the email, but to actually send it we have to switch back to Outlook.
	4.	When attaching multiple documents, only one is attached successfully – additional attachments fail.
	5.	Inline images are not supported; when we paste them, they appear only as attachments, not within the email body.
	6.	When replying to emails, the case is not auto-tagged to the child record.
	7.	Once an email is sent externally, there is only a 2-minute cancellation window. Beyond that, we cannot make edits, which means drafting the entire email again if changes are needed.
