As you all know, we’re soon migrating from Outlook to Salesforce, which offers a more convenient platform with enhanced features and rule capabilities. If there’s any feature you feel is currently missing in the shared mailbox and would like to have it added in Salesforce, please do highlight it.

You can reach out to me or Raghu with your suggestions.
