1.	FXMMPOST Auto-Tagging Enhancement
	•	One of the biggest challenges in 2022 was manual mailbox tagging and clearing—time-consuming and inefficient.
	•	I implemented an auto-tagging logic based on BOLT ownership. This ensured emails reached only relevant users.
	•	Result: Drastic reduction in irrelevant emails and improved ROTA tagging speed and accuracy.
	•	Outcome: Increased efficiency and higher user satisfaction through accurate and timely routing.
	2.	Data Clean-Up & Static Update for INCL Recs
	•	Moved internal clients to INCL recs by correcting static mapping, which was incorrectly tied to Nostro accounts.
	•	Outcome: Reduced break counts, minimized unnecessary email loops, and improved STP (Straight Through Processing).
	3.	BRCY Standards Update for Payment Processing
	•	Identified issue with GBS payments failing due to missing BRCY standards.
	•	Took initiative to raise Service Form (SF) to update BRCY for exotic currencies.
	•	Result: Payments now clearing without failure.
	4.	WG Mailbox Efficiency
	•	Currently, 50% of emails are auto-closed without any manual intervention.
	•	That’s around 4,500 emails closed monthly, freeing up valuable team time.
